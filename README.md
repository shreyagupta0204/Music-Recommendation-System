# Music-Recommendation-System
A music recommendation system is a tool that suggests songs or artists to users based on their preferences, listening history, or patterns. It uses algorithms like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid models to analyze data such as user interactions, song characteristics, and ratings. The system learns user preferences over time, providing personalized recommendations that match their tastes. For instance, it might suggest new songs similar to those the user has enjoyed before or recommend tracks that others with similar tastes have liked. Such systems are commonly found in music streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube.
